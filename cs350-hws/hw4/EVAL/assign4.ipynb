    "In this EVAL problem, we will study the behavior of the system when multiple processors (a.k.a. threads in this case) are available to process the incoming workload. For this part, make sure to have at least $w$+2 processors available in your system, where $w$ is the number of worker threads that we will start. The extra two threads are needed for the client and the parent thread, respectively."

For this part, simply explain how you recovered that information for your machine. If you are using SCC, you can select required number of CPUs. However, still verify that you indeed received it, explain how you did it here."
